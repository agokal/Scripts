# Scripts

Some scripts I made to make my life a littie easier.

NoSleep - Stops a Windows Machine from sleeping, without changing the systems power settings. emulates a scroll lock key press ever min (or 2 min; can't remember) until the script is stopped.

TowerWOL.bat - WOL for my home server.

bin/ -  directory for all my Bash script.
  hello-world - test script to make sure my bash envoirnment is lineked to folder correctly. prints "hello-world" to terminal
  JavaAuto -  compiles all .java files in present diesctory and then runs the .class file of the command line argument.
      Ex. JavaAuto test
          >> will copile all .java files in dir
          javac .java
          >> will execute the argument file
          java test
